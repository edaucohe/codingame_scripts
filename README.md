## Description <a class="anchor" id="description"></a>

"Codingame scripts" aims to collect some mini scripts that I have found on the Codingame platform.

I have tried to improve the code of these mini scripts due to the lack of good practices I have found
during development and the conditions in which the programs proposed by the platform are carried out.

## Installation <a class="anchor" id="installation"></a>

Python version : 3.9.4

To get project, launch :
```
https://github.com/edaucohe/codingame_scripts.git
```

To create virtual environment, go into the folder `../codingame/` and launch :
```
python -m venv env  
```

To activate virtual environment, launch :

- In windows
```
source env/Scripts/activate
```

```

```

The script will display a navigation menu in order to choice the mini script what you want to execute.
